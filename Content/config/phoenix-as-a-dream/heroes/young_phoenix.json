Just when he thought he was doomed, he accidentally triggered an ancient relic on the battlefield and was transported to another worldâ€”the continent of Antagarich in Colony. He spent ten years in Standwick, becoming a powerful mage in his quest to find a way back. One day, he unexpectedly encountered a king from his own world, but this meeting was too unexpected. Before he could figure out why the king had also come to this world, his king was already on the execution platform, beheaded by the executioner. Through his investigation, he discovered that it was the royal family of Erathia that had framed his king. Fueled by intense hatred, he joined the forces of Eeofol, vowing to destroy Erathia as his lifelong goal.\r\n\r\nBy chance, he met a golden sun element from Bracada. This golden sun element had a mishap while transforming into a Firebird, losing its immunity to fire magic and uncontrollably releasing its nuclear fusion energy. Realizing that this golden sun element, in conjunction with efreetis, would be a formidable war machine, he persuaded it to join his army and granted it the rank of commander. The golden sun element gladly accepted, and he named it \"Young Phoenix.\"",
