He was also a mage, a rare profession in their low-magic world. Using his magical skills, he spent ten years tracking the king to another world and constructed a one-way teleportation array. After arranging state affairs, he resolutely stepped through the portal, knowing well he might never return. However, in the new world, he only found the previously missing generalâ€”Henry Tao. Upon learning from Henry that the king had tragically died in Erathia, he was furious but did not join Eeofol, as he disliked the fickle demons. Instead, he became a mage of Nighon. Due to the differences between the two worlds, he gained some extraordinary magical abilities but could not receive certain magical enhancements from Colony.",
